/**
 * Per-player state of the {@code IsoPlayer.updateLOS} override ({@code playerLosFast}, 2026-09-22).
 *
 * <p>Stock keeps the objects a player has spotted since the last quiet spell in a {@link Stack} ({@code lastSpotted})
 * and asks it {@code contains} for every object spotted this frame, plus once more for every zombie within a few
 * tiles: a linear walk of a synchronized {@code Vector}. The list only empties when a whole frame spots no zombie at
 * all, so in a horde it holds every zombie the player ever saw, and the walk is spotted × remembered identity
 * compares per frame — 2,400 × 2,400 with the Louisville preset's spectator view, 12 % of the game thread and
 * growing with the horde. This keeps an identity set beside the stack and answers the same question in one probe.
 *
 * <p>The stack stays the source of truth (it is exposed through {@code getLastSpotted} / {@code setLastSpotted}):
 * {@link #sync} rebuilds the set whenever the stack object or its size is not what the set last mirrored, so any
 * outside clear, add or replacement is picked up before the set is consulted, and the override adds / clears through
 * {@link #add} / {@link #clear} so both stay equal within a frame. Game thread only, like the stack. Generic so the
 * JVM-only test needs no game objects; the override uses it with {@code IsoMovingObject}.
