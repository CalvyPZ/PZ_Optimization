/**
 * Keeps baked chunk-level textures across camera zoom changes (Config.ZOOM_RETAIN, 2026-09-22).
 *
 * Stock frees a chunk level's textures the frame it leaves the screen (FBORenderCell.checkNewlyOnScreenChunks,
 * FBORenderLevels.freeFBOsForLevel) and creates them again, DIRTY_CREATE, when it returns. Zooming in shrinks the
 * screen, so it frees most of what was visible; zooming back out re-bakes every one of those levels, in the frame
 * they return: a 0.25 to 2.5 wheel spin at 5120x2160 is 320 to 410 bakes in one frame, 80 to 375 ms (stock
 * runs zs-out-jump9); a single notch out at wide zoom is a 45 to 51 ms frame (zs-out-wheel).
 *
 * The rule here: a level's normal-scale texture is kept while its chunk lies inside the screen rectangle the widest
 * zoom would show (the same set stock holds at that zoom, so the texture memory stays within stock's own maximum);
 * the high-res texture (used below zoom 0.75) while the chunk lies inside the rectangle of the widest zoom below
 * 0.75. The rectangles are centred on the camera character like the camera itself (PlayerCamera.center), one chunk
 * of margin. A chunk unloading still frees everything (FBORenderLevels.freeChunk).
