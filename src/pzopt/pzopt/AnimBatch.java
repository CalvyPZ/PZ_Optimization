/**
 * The zombies' animation bone math on the other cores ({@code animBonesParallel}, 2026-09-22).
 *
 * <p>Every zombie with a 3D model spends its postupdate in {@code AnimationPlayer.Update}: the multi-track tick (which
 * fires the animation events) and then the standard-animation math, i.e. blending every track's keyframes into the bone
 * transforms, the body angles, the twist bones, the model-space and skin matrices. On the Louisville horde preset that
 * math is 9 % of the game thread (17 % for the whole zombie postupdate, 98 % busy). It only touches the player's own
 * arrays, the read-only clips, thread-safe pools and the scratch objects the override made thread-local, so it can run
 * anywhere: during {@code MovingObjectUpdateScheduler.postupdate()} the override's {@code updateInternal} keeps the
 * multi-track tick on the game thread and hands the rest to this batch; after the last object the batch runs on the
 * {@link FrameBatch} workers and the game thread together and is joined before anything (attachments, the render data)
 * reads a bone.
 *
 * <p>Not batched: players and animals, a zombie without a model (its update is non-visual), a zombie being grappled or
 * grappling (the other side reads its bones in the same loop), one that reanimated a dead player (the player copies its
 * bones right after), a ragdoll, a recording player, a child player (copies its parent's bones). Those run inline.
 *
 * <p>The batch runs after the loop rather than overlapping it because {@code IsoGameCharacter.updateAnimPlayer} (the
 * model-less path, most of a horde) flips {@code PerformanceSettings.interpolateAnims} around each call and the keyframe
 * sampling reads that flag.
